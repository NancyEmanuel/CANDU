  <h3>VR Model of a Candu Calandria</h3>
  
  <div class="paragraph">
      <p>This video showcases our VR model of the CANDU Calandria.The VR environment is comprised of a full-scale model of a CANDU
          reactor and a variety of simulations to demonstrate its functionality. This project incorporates innovative virtual reality technologies to the nuclear field to
          modernize the education and training process regarding CANDU reactors. A remotely accessible VR
          model and simulations of the CANDU nuclear reactor for online teaching and training provides an
          interactive, and immersive full-scale 3D model of a CANDU reactor. The VR environment of the 3D
          CANDU reactor allows users to walk-through and explore its mechanisms and functions.</p>
